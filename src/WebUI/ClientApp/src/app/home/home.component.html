<h1>Angular/WebAPI Starter Kit Blog</h1>
<p>The starter kit prototype is built with:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href='https://angular.io/'>Google Angular 8.0</a> and <a href='http://www.typescriptlang.org/'>TypeScript 3.4</a> for client-side code</li>
  <li><a href='https://get.asp.net/'>Microsoft ASP.NET Core 3.1</a> and <a href='https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/67ef8sbd.aspx'>C#</a> for cross-platform server-side code</li>
  <li><a href='http://getbootstrap.com/'>Twitter Bootstrap 4.3</a> for layout and styling</li>
</ul>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>
  The purpose of this blog is to get developers familiar with Clean Architecture design which is based on practical software solutions from the legendary Robert C. Martin (“Uncle Bob”).
  Please refer to Architecture References section for further explanation.
</p>

<p>
  Many of us are familiar with the three-tiered architecture.  The UI layer couples with the Business layer and therefore the Database layer.
  As a result, everything in the application is dependent on the database layer, which can become unmanageable overtime.  Does contorted IDB (Integrated Database Broker) ring a bell?
</p>
<p>
  So why not stay with the three-tiered architecture?  Let’s consider how often organization and applications make changes to their database.
  Let's upgrade PeopleSoft database to cloud HCM.  Let's move all the business logic in stored procedures to the testable middle-tier.  Let's containerize and run apps inside Docker.
  None of these changes have anything to do with the application core business functionality.  Yet it will require significant re-write effort.  
</p>

<p>
  How to build application system that is adaptable to changes?  Answer:  adopt Clean Architecture and object-oriented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">SOLID</a> principles as <strong>coding standard</strong>.
  With Clean Architecture, application components are tightly integrated yet loosely coupled.  In layman's term, it is a practice of using Screw vs Nail when assemble furniture.
</p>
<h2>Prototype Features</h2>
<p>
  This prototype is a demonstration of Clean Architecture concept.  
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/">Home</a> - homepage of the prototype</li>
  <li><a href="/Identity/Account/Register">Register</a> - demonstration of independent storage (user accounts can be in database Or Azure AD)</li>
  <li><a href="/Identity/Account/Login">Login</a> - demonstration of interface segregation for flexible identity management; login with Asp.Net Identity (accounts in the database) Or Azure AD/MFA.  <strong>If you have dosdev account, give it a try.</strong></li>
  <li><a href="/counter">Counter</a> - demonstration of anonymous access to application page</li>
  <li><a href="/fetch-data">Fetch data</a> - demonstration of securing downstream WebAPI (WebAPI calling WebAPI - weather service in this example)</li>
  <li><a href="/todo">Todo</a> - demonstration of CRUD using ORM Entity Framework against MSSQL SaS database; securing WebAPI with Identity Connect and oAuth2/Scopes</li>
  <li><a href="/api">Swagger</a> - demonstration of OpenAPI and JWT token to explore WebAPI via web browser</li>
  <li><a href="/health">Health Check</a> - endpoint for reporting health status; probes available for websites, databases (MSSQL, Oracle, etc.), and infrastructure services (SMTP, Log, etc.)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Clean Architecture References</h2>
<p>Source/Credit: <a href="https://jasontaylor.dev/clean-architecture-getting-started">https://jasontaylor.dev/clean-architecture-getting-started </a></p>
<p>With Clean Architecture (see picture below), the <strong>Domain </strong>and <strong>Application </strong>layers are at the center of the design. This is known as the <strong>Core </strong>of the system.</p>
<p>The <strong>Domain</strong> layer contains enterprise logic and types and the <strong>Application </strong>layer contains app-specific business logic and types. The difference is that enterprise logic could be shared across many applications, whereas the app-specific business logic will typically only be used within a specific application.</p>
<p><strong>Core </strong>should not be dependent on data access and other infrastructure concerns so those dependencies are inverted.  This is achieved by adding interfaces or abstractions within <strong>Core</strong> that are implemented by layers outside of <strong>Core</strong>. For example, if you wanted to implement the <a href="https://deviq.com/repository-pattern/">Repository</a> pattern you would do so by adding an interface within <strong>Core </strong>and adding the implementation within <strong>Infrastructure</strong>. </p>
<p>All dependencies flow inwards and <strong>Core </strong>has no dependency on any other layers. <strong>Infrastructure </strong>and <strong>Presentation </strong>depend on <strong>Core</strong>, but not on one another.</p>
<img src="https://rules.ssw.com.au/PublishingImages/onion-view-clean-architecture.png" class="img-fluid"/>
<p><strong>Figure: Clean Architecture Diagram</strong></p>

<p>This results in architecture and design:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Independent of frameworks</strong>   it does not require the existence of some tool or framework</li><li><strong>Testable</strong>   easy to test &#8211; <strong>Core </strong>has no dependencies on anything external, so writing automated tests is much easier</li><li><strong>Independent of UI</strong>   logic is kept out of the UI so it is easy to change to another technology &#8211; right now we might be using Angular, React, eventually Blazor!</li><li><strong>Independent of the database</strong>   data-access concerns are cleanly separated so moving from SQL Server to Oracle or otherwise is trivial</li><li><strong>Independent of anything external</strong>   in fact, <strong>Core </strong>is completely isolated from the outside world &#8211; the difference between a system that will last 3 years, and one that will last 20 years</li></ul>
<p>In the above design, there are only three circles and there could be more. Think of this as a starting point. Just remember to keep all dependencies pointing inwards.</p>


<h2>Use Case</h2>
<p>Suppose we want to upgrade ACRS (Position Classification for Civil Services) and MCLASS (Position Classification for Foreign Services).  How to apply Clean Architecture onion-view (see Figure above)?  What are the benefits?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Domain - Both apps share cross-cutting entities such as Employee, Jobcode, Grade, Assignment, Occupational Series, Bargaining, etc.  Implement these entities as enterprise-wide REST WebAPI resources.  Benefits:  less code to write and maintain.</li>
  <li>Application - ACRS contains business rules pertaining to domestic (OPM) while MCLASS contains business rules pertaining to Oversea.  Keep app-specific business rules in the Application layer.  Benefits:  testable business rules.</li>
  <li>Presentation - Both ACRS and MCLASS can be upgraded to Angular.  Fork the Angular Accelerator starter kit to jump start the UI. Benefits: consistent UI.</li>
  <li>Persistence - With ORM library, storage can be Oracle or MSSQL.  Use ORM library such as EF or Dapper to decouple data access from vendor specific databases.   Benefits:  both apps can be moved to a common database without code change.</li>
  <li>Infrastructure - Email, File Storage, Workflow Engine, Identity Management, Health Check and Application Logging are interface implementations.  Benefits:  configurable and swappable services (tightly integrated yet loosely coupled,).</li>
</ul>
